iOS-UpsidePrototype
===================

Prototype application of Upside App

For Upside Commerce tech team, this is a prototype I built yesterday afternoon.
After speaking with Jeff earlier in the week, I wanted to quickly show him - and the rest of the company - some
of my abilities.
This prototype app of the current Upside iOS application is an effort to communicate that I could provide
value to the technical efforts of the company.

The application demonstrates:
-- Custom Annimation.
-- Transferring data intra-app with NSNotificationCenter.
-- Custom UICollectionViews

Happy coding!
